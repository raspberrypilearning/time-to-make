Place the wheel on the box, and draw around it.

Move the wheel to four positions with even spacing between them and draw around the window at each position. This is where you will add the text.

Decorate the box however you like.

Then, add your four text options.

**Tip:** Make the text a little bit smaller than the window so that there is room for error.
