Make a hole in the centre of each spacer circle with a sharp pencil.

Decorate the wheel however you like.

Then, attach the wheel to the spacer circles with tape or glue. If the wheel feels loose, you could add some sticky tack or a small amount of hot glue to make it more secure.

Unplug the LED and glue or tape it to the box. 

**Tip:** The LED should fit under the wheel because of the spacer circles, but you can add it anywhere you like on the box.
