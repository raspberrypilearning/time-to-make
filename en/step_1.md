## What you will make

**Time to Make** is a spinning wheel chooser made from cardboard and a stepper motor. It randomly selects one of four options each time it turns.

You can make your own version! Yours could:
- ask quiz questions
- get yes or no answers
- generate story ideas
- or decide chores like who cooks

### You will need for the circuit:
- stepper motor and driver
- Pico
- USB cable for the Pico
- pin-to-pin and socket-to-pin wires
- button
- 1-2 LEDs

To program the Raspberry Pi Pico you will need the [Thonny IDE](http://thonny.org/){:target="_blank"} and MicroPython packages installed. Instructions for this are [available here.](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/2){:target="_blank"}
