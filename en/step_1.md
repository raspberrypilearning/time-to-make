## What you will make

**Time to Make** is a spinning selection wheel made from cardboard and a stepper motor. It randomly selects one of four options each time it turns.

You can make your own version! Yours could:
- ask quiz questions
- get yes or no answers
- generate story ideas
- or decide chores like who cooks

See the wheel in action. Sound on 🔊
