## What you will make

Make a spinning selection wheel with cardboard and a stepper motor. The selection wheel will  reveal one of four options each time it turns.

You can design your own selection wheel to help you in lots of different ways! For example, your selection wheel could:
- Ask quiz questions
- Give yes or no answers
- Generate story ideas
- Decide chores like who cooks

See the selection wheel in action. Sound on 🔊
